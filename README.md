# Employee
An Employee Management System is used to manage Employees in the company. It is used to display the details of all employees such as Employee Name, Salary, Post, etc.  A company can promote employees, update their salaries, and remove employees using an Employee Management System.

Functionality:  A Employee can do the following things with this Employee Management System:

Display Employee
Add Employee
Remove Employee
Promote Employee (Update Post)
Update Salary 
Approach: We are going to use Body Parser by which we can capture user input values from the form such as the employee’s name, post, and salary &  store them in a collection. Then we will send the employee’s data to the web page using EJS. EJS is a middleware that makes it easy to send data from your server file (app.js or server.js) to a web page. We will also create the Discharge Route for discharging the patients.
